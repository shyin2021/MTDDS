Following are some comments on the provided folders and files.
1. Files in the folder benchmarkInputFiles contains the input files used to set the parameter values for a benchmarking run. They are edited mannually and will be read by programs.
2. Files in the folder step1Queries_TPCDS have been generated by running the TPC-DS tool kit downloaded from https://www.tpc.org/.
3. The folder step2Scripts_PostgresXL contains the scripts (Shell and SQL) used to generate data and load these data into the databases for the Power Test.
4. The folder step3ExecPlans contains the query execution plans chosen by Postgres-XL (as well as the execution times) when running the Power Test. We used .pl as extension of the the execution plan files, but they are actually plain texte files, so can be opened by a simple text editor.
5. The folder step6SourceScript contains the creation.sql file generated by the TPC-DS tool kit. This file is used as a template to generate CREATE TABLE scripts for each tenant.
6. The folder step8ExecTraces contains the execution traces printed by the driver programs running in Step 6. They will be transformed into another format so that the scores related to the benchmark metrics could be computed more easily.
