We used the source code of the CAB benchmark available on GitHub (https://github.com/alexandervanrenen/cab) to generate the tenants' query streams. Then, we used the TPC-H tookit to genrate data and queries. We started with a very small CAB factor (0.1) to see how it works. The obtained results have already confirmed the observation in the sub-sections 6.2 and 6.3 of the CAB paper [Renen'2023]. Therefore, we did not continue other CAB runs. Instead, we recommend interested readers to see more deeply analysis in [Renen'2023].
